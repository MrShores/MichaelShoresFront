            <div class="content">


                <p class="lead">In 2007, I started a short-lived comedy writing blog. It was my first foray into websites and it quickly hooked me. In fact, I liked building and maintaining the site so much that I dropped the writing altogether to learn about design and development.</p>

                <p class="cap">I fell deep down the rabbit hole of design and development. Photoshop, HTML+CSS, Typography, jQuery, Wordpress, Color theory, Data Visualization, Python and Django. And now after a degree in graphic design, working as a User Experience designer for CALpers, being Creative Director of IDMLOCO, and teaching web design at CSU, Sacramento, the hole still goes. Machine Learning, C++, React.js, Data Science,…</p>

                <h2>Skill Level: Solid+</h2>

                <p>The hardest part of hiring a developer or designer is <strong>trust</strong>. You have to ask yourself &#8220;Is this person competent enough to do what I need done?&#8221;. It&#8217;s an important question.</p>

                <p>To give you a better sense of my level of expertise and competence, I&#8217;ve prepared a list of insights and opinions on web development that will give you an idea of where I fit.</p>

                <h2>Strengths</h2>

                <h3>Complex Problem Solving</h3>

                <p>I&#8217;ve studied math theory, philosophy and logic, and graphic design. A seemingly random mix at first. But they all work expressly in solving problems.</p>

                <h3>Divergent Thinking</h3>

                <p>There&#8217;s always a solution to something, it just may not be what you thought it was going to be. Alternative ideas, methods, and approaches give you more leverage. Goes hand-in-hand with <em>Complex Problem Solving</em>.</p>

                <h3>Clear Communication</h3>

                <p>Clear interpersonal communication may be the most important skill you can have. As a creative director, writing clear emails to clients, designers, and developers was a easily double-digit percentage of my role. Clear communication is the oil that makes the whole working process work. Design skills and coding chops don&#8217;t matter if you can&#8217;t write a good email. </p>
